**Introduction**

I recently completed a post graduate programme in data science and business analytics. This repository includes the following:
  - Projects completed as part of a post graduate programme 
  - Additional data analytics and modelling work I completed outside the course to learn tensorflow, and work done with with a hotel to provide insights about       the business using its data.

**Contents**

_What are the topics covered?_

It starts with basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) using python to application of various machine learning models and provides an example of a tensorflow application which includes a classification and regression problem.

_How to navigate through the repository?_

- the main topic covered through each project in the name of the file
- every project has two files and it is recommended to go in the following order when you want to explore a project
  a) a .pdf file is a slide deck providing an introduction to the project, business problem, overview of the data, approach taken, key insights and recommendation 
  
  b) a .ipynb file which is the jupyter notebook which has the executed python code to deliver the project

**Feedback and Queries**

Any feedback will be greatly appreciated as I continue to learn more about the exciting world of data, ML and AI. Please send any feedback or queries to nibukuriakose@gmail.com
